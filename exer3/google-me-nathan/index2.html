            <p>
              Apart from school/computer science, I love photography, video
              games, climbing, and fashion! In my free time, I love to take
              street photography but I unfortunately dont have all too much time
              to do so. As for videogames, I play when I can but when i was
              younger, I was extremely invested in Halo: Combat Evolved. My
              favorite games to date are Fallout: New Vegas, Counter-Strike 2 (I
              peaked Distinguished Master Guardian!), and Terraria. As for
              fashion, I love to dress up and learn about different brands and
              cool pieces. For me, fashion is my way of artistically expressing
              myself. It makes me feel confident and encourages me to induldge
              in outside activities. I do not have much to say about climbing
              but it is a really fun sport that really gets your body going. I
              try to go climbing 2-3 times a week not just for my health but
              also for detoxing from school.

            <p>
              I wanted to include music as its own sections as I feel there's so
              much fun to talk about. You can learn a lot about another person
              just by what music they like to listen to. For me, I am currently
              very into electronic/hyperpop artists like 2hollis or Nate Sib.
              I've also always been into RnB/LoFi with artists like Joji and
              Bryson Tiller being big ones. Another big one is rap and I am
              currently very into the UK underground scene with artists like
              Feng and Fakemink leading that passion for me. Music for me is an
              outlet for nearly anything as there are so many situations I can
              think of where I can just listen to music to calm down!
